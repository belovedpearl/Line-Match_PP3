 ## Project Description

---

 Line match is a fun game that prompts its users to guess what row is like ly to be uniform i.e contain the same letter in a 5 by 5 matrix randomly generated by the computer based on already defined constants.

 The user gains points when his guess matches 1 or more of the rows and losses his points with wrong guesses. He is able to continue playing the game until he runs out of point or when his points is less than the required points to proceed. 


---

## HOW TO PLAY

---

   * The user is allowed to decide on his starting points.
   * Computer randomly creates a 5 by 5 grid of alphebet containing the letters (WXYZ).
   * The user is to guess what row is likely to contain the same alphabet.
   * Choose 1 to guess only the first line will be the same.
   * Choose 2 to guess the first two lines will be the same.
   * Choose 3 to guess the first three lines will be the same.
   * Choose 4 to guess the first four lines will be the same.
   * Choose 5 to guess all five lines will be the same.
   * From the starting point, the user is prompted to commit some points to each line of guess.
   * Continue to play till you run out of point or have less point to continue your game.

## Features

---

### Existing Features

The welcome screen features the name of the game made with ASCII art generator

 ***Instruction Section*** : This can be accessed by following the prompt that leads to "i". For ease, instruction section leads directly to the main game


***Play Game Section***: This is accessed either by following the prompt that leads to " press p to play game" or from the instruction section. It was planned this way to give ease of access to returning users that will no longer need to access the game instruction to play the game.  


![Home Page](assets/images/siteRepresentation/homepage.webp)

***Computer Match display***: This displays to the user the match made by the computer.

---

### Instruction Page

 * This page displays the game instruction to guide the user.

**Game Page**

This page displays the quiz body for users to interract with after starting the game, it keeps a record of right question answered, wrong question chosen and it also features a progress bar a visual representation of how well the user is doing with the quiz.

The page consist of the following:
* A section that contains the image of the historic center.
* An option area from which the user can select a choice.
* A progress bar to keep the user informed about correct choice made.
* Score area to update the user on the number of questions answered right.
* A section to keep the user informed about the number of questions answered wrong.
* Count showing the number of questions answered.

Once the page is loaded, the user is expected to make a choice from the list to view the next question.

Each right answer attracts 10 points, the total is presented to the user at the end of the game.

**Endpage**

   This page opens up after 10 questions have been answered by the user or when the player runs out of the allocated time.
   It presents the player's total score and a detailed summary of questions answered right and questions answered wrong.
   The end message address the user with the provided username putting forward a congratulatory message on the score and number of questions answered right.
   This page consist of a home button which takes the user to the start of the game and resets the game to the start point. 
   
   It also consist of a **Save Score** button which saves the player's score if pressed and can be viewed on the highscore page **if** it meets top 5 scores. Save score is designed to take one click per game to prevent repeating scores saved.


![End Page](assets/images/siteRepresentation/lscreen_end.webp)

## Future Features

---

 * I will add audio to improve user experience of the game.

 * Add an autosave feature.

 * Features that allow users to choose some custom settings to personalize the game.

 * Randomize the position of each option.

 * Add a reward section where users can choose a gift based on the scores they get.

 * Connect with social media account of users to provide a means to share the game scores online.

---

## Design Choices

---


* For simplicity and my hope to learn more so that users can improve the game appearance to their desired choice, I have opted to use linear gradient to design the body.

* I have added box shadow to the sections to better present it to users.


### Font

* Andika
    * I believe it is a clean font for this game and its bold, its source is google font.
* Sans-serif
    * This is set as a fall-back font for device that might not load google fonts and its easily available.


### Colour Scheme

   
I have selected a mix of blue shades **(rgb(32,201, 255) 36.7%)**, **(rgb(52, 79, 88) 84.4%)**, **black** and **White** to complement site appearance.
Using [color contrast checker](https://dequeuniversity.com/) have checked the contrast of both colors use as foreground and background. Contrast result gave the following.

I have maintained a button text color change to white on hovering to alert the user of the mouse presence on each button.

## Accessibility

---

Logo opens up to the opening page.

Buttons are used for easy navigation across different section of the application. 


---

## Technology, Frameworks and Programs

---

### Languages

* PYTHON


---

### Frameworks and Programs


* Lucid charts
    * Used to plan the project


* Github
    * To store written code


* Code Anywhere
    * The developement environment used to  write the code where I could commit and push my changes to Github.

## Bugs

---

### Fixed Bugs

* Start Game button submits without inputing a username. 
    * Adding an if statement to check if there is a name in the input fixed this.
* I discover I could use the "Save Score button" multiple times on a game.
    * Disabling the button after executing its function solved this.
* I noticed favicon was not displaying.
    * Properly writing the link by including the absolute path fixed this.


### Unfixed Bugs
 * To my current understanding, there is no unfixed bug

---

## Deployment

---

### GitHub Pages

* The project was deployed using heroku.

The following illustrate the steps I took to deploy my website;
Fork or clone this repository in the following steps:
### How to Fork

  * Login to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/belovedpearl/Line-Match_PP3).

  * At the top of the repository just above the **"Settings"** button on the menu, locate the **"Fork"** button.

  * Once **clicked**, you should have a copy of the original repository in your own account.

### To deploy

  * Create a new Heroku app.
  * Set the build packs to Python and NodeJs in exact order.
  * Link the Heroku app to the repository.
  * Click on **Deploy**
  * A few minutes later, after refreshing the page, there will automatically be an update containing the **"live site link"**.
